## Project Vision
Our vision is to democratize access to micro-financing through decentralized technology. By isolating lending pools, we ensure that risks are contained and lenders can set their own terms. This model empowers both borrowers and lenders, fostering a more inclusive and flexible financial ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Isolated Lending Pools**: Each pool operates independently, reducing systemic risk and allowing custom interest rates and loan terms.
- **Customizable Terms**: Lenders can specify interest rates, maximum loan amounts, and repayment durations.
- **Efficient Liquidity Management**: Lenders can add and withdraw liquidity as needed, ensuring flexibility.
- **Transparent Loan Tracking**: Borrowers and lenders can view loan details, including repayment status and interest earned.
- **Decentralized and Secure**: Built on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability.
